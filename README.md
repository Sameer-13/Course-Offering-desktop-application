# Course-Offering
Course Offering is a desktop application built in java using the JavaFX framework, which is basically an application that helps university students to build and organize their schedules without worrying about manually checking sections' times and days conflicts, along with displaying and simulating their schedules. Moreover, it enables users to save their schedules and import them into and from their devices whenever they want by writing and reading sections as a binary file.
